## Overview

packrs is a Rust-based build tool that streamlines development for React projects. It leverages rsbuild to optimize and simplify the build process.

## Features

- **Efficient Builds**: Powered by rsbuild for fast performance.
- **React Support**: Built-in support for React SPAs.
- **Customizable**: Tailor builds with plugins and scripts.
- **Node.js API**: Exclusively supports Node.js API usage.

## Why only support Node.js API?

To offer a flexible and customizable API, packrs supports only the Node.js API. This allows full use of rsbuild's capabilities, enabling custom build processes and plugins. A CLI would restrict customization and require assumptions about project structure, reducing API flexibility.

To install packrs, run the following command:

```bash
npm install packrs --save-dev
yarn add -D packrs
```

## Usage

### Development Mode

```typescript
const { run } = require('packrs');

run({
  index: './src/index',
  dist: './dist',
});
```

This will continuously watch for changes and rebuild the project automatically.

### Building mode

```typescript
const { build } = require('packrs');

build({
  index: './src/index',
  dist: './dist',
});
```

This command will execute the build process using rsbuild and output the files to the designated directory.

### Type definitons for run and build api

```typescript
/**
 * Parameters for the `build` and `run` functions.
 */
type Params = {
  /**
   * Indicates if Less should be used.
   * The default is `true`.
   */
  less: boolean;
  /**
   * Indicates if Sass should be used.
   * The default is `true`.
   */
  sass: boolean;
  /**
   * The entry file for the project. relative path to project e.g. ./src/index.tsx
   */
  index:
    | string
    | string[]
    | (RsbuildEntryDescription & {
        html?: boolean;
      });
  /**
   * The output directory for the project. relative path to project e.g. ./dist
   */
  dist: string;
  /**
   * The port for the dev server., default: 3000
   */
  port?: number;
  /**
   * The proxy setting for the dev server.
   */
  proxy?: ProxyConfig;
  /**
   * The banner text for the project.
   */
  banner?: string;
  /**
   * jsx runtime,  React version before 16.14.0ï¼Œpls set runtime 'classic'
   * default:automatic
   */
  reactRuntime?: 'automatic' | 'classic';
  /**
   * Rsbuild configuration
   */
  rsConfig?: RsbuildConfig;
};
```
